<h1>Introducing Components</h1>
<p>
An Angular component is similar to an AngularJS Controller. 
A component is basically markup, meta-data, and a class (containing data and code)
 that combined together create a UI widget. Components are the main tools we use to 
 build an interactive UI with. All Angular applications have a root component, 
 often called the application component.
